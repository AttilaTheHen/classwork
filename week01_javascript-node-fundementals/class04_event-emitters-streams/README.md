## Questions and Feedback

* `mocha -w` hangs on some errors
    * `nodemon`
* ?

## Learning Objectives

* Have a working model of asynchronous programming using events in NodeJS
* Utilize events and event emitters
* Utilize streaming and chunking to reduce memory usage

## Agenda

### Event Emitter pattern

* Subscribe and use an event emitter
* Streams
    * as event emitters:
        * `on`: `data` and `close`
    * `write`
* Files as streams
    * Demo fs.createReadStream()
